Create list pages for customers and trainings. Create navigation for two list pages.

List pages should contain following features:

Sorting
Searching (or Filtering)
Training list should also show a customer name and format the date in the table, eg dd.mm.yyyy hh:mm
Note! You can use for example Dayjs or Date-fns libraries for date formatting.
